upgrade:
  - |
    The octavia user is no longer given the admin role in the admin
    project. Octavia does not require this role and instead uses octavia
    user with admin role in service project. During an upgrade the octavia user
    is removed from the admin project.

    For existing deployments this may cause problems, so a
    ``octavia_service_auth_project`` variable has been added which may be set
    to ``admin`` to return to the previous behaviour.

    To switch an existing deployment from using the ``admin`` project to the
    ``service`` project, it will at least be necessary to create the required
    security group in the ``service`` project, and update
    ``octavia_amp_secgroup_list`` to this group's ID. Ideally the Amphora
    flavor and network would also be recreated in the ``service`` project,
    although this does not appear to be necessary for operation, and will
    impact existing Amphorae.

    See `bug 1873176 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/kolla-ansible/+bug/1873176>`__
    for details.
