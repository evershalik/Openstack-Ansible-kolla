    Fixes an issue with Docker client timeouts where Docker reports 'Read
    timed out'. The client timeout may be configured via
    ``docker_client_timeout``. The default timeout has been increased to 120
    seconds. See `bug
    <https://bugs.launchpad.net/kolla-ansible/+bug/1809844>`__ for details.
