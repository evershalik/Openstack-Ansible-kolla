    Fixes `LP#1892210
    <https://bugs.launchpad.net/kolla-ansible/+bug/1892210>`__ where the number
    of open connections to Memcached from ``neutron-server`` would grow over
    time until reaching the maximum set by ``memcached_connection_limit`` (5000
    by default), at which point the Memcached instance would stop working.
