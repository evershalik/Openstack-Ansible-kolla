    Fixes an issue with Nova live migration not using
    ``migration_interface_address`` even when TLS was not used.
    When migrating an instance to a newly added compute host, if addressing
    depended on ``/etc/hosts`` and it had not been updated on the
    source compute host to include the new compute host, live migration would
    fail. This did not affect DNS-based name resolution.
    Analogically, Nova live migration would fail if the address in
    DNS/``/etc/hosts`` was not the same as ``migration_interface_address``
    due to user customization.
