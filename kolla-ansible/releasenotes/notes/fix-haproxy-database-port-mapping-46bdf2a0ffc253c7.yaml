upgrade:
  - MariaDB is now exposed via HAProxy on the ``database_port`` and
    not the ``mariadb_port``. Out of the box these are both the same,
    but if you have customised ``mariadb_port`` so that it is different
    to the ``database_port`` and you have a service talking to it
    via HAProxy on that port then you should review your configuration.
