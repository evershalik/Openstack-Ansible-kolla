    The ``admin-openrc.sh`` file generated by ``kolla-ansible post-deploy`` was
    previously created with ``root:root`` ownership and ``644`` permissions.
    This would allow anyone with access to the same directory to read the file,
    including the admin credentials. The ownership of ``admin-openrc.sh`` is
    now set to the user executing ``kolla-ansible``, and the file is assigned a
    mode of ``600``. This change can be applied by running ``kolla-ansible
    post-deploy``.
