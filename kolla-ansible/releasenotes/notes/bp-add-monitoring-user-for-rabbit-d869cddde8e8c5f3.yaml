    Kolla-Ansible now supports creating a monitoring
    user for RabbitMQ.
    As an operator I want to be able to monitor the status
    of RabbitMQ by collecting metrics such as queue length,
    message rates (globally and per channel), and information
    about resource usage on the host, such as memory use,
    open file descriptors and the state of the cluster. Whilst
    it is possible to gather all of this information using
    the OpenStack RabbitMQ user configured by Kolla Ansible,
    this user has write access to the OpenStack vhost. This
    feature adds a monitoring user which has access to all of
    the information described above, but does not have write
    access. An example of a service which may use the
    monitoring user is the RabbitMQ plugin for the Monasca
    Agent. As not all users will configure monitoring, by
    default the monitoring user is disabled. To create it,
    the user should override the rabbitmq_monitoring_user
    variable.
