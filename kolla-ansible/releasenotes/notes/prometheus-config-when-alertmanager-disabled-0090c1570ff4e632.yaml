    Fixes templating of Prometheus configuration when Alertmanager is disabled.
    In a deployment where Prometheus is enabled and Alertmanager is disabled
    the configuration for the Prometheus will fail when templating as the
    variable ``prometheus_alert_rules`` does not contain the key ``files``.
