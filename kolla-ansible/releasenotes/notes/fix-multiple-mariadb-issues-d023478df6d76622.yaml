    Fixes MariaDB issues in multinode scenarios which affected
    deployment, reconfiguration, upgrade and Galera cluster resizing.
    They were usually manifested by WSREP issues in various places
    and could lead to need to recover the Galera cluster.
    Note these issues were due to how MariaDB was handled during
    Kolla Ansible runs and did not affect Galera cluster during normal
    operations unless MariaDB was later touched by Kolla Ansible.
    Users wishing to run actions on their Galera clusters using
    Kolla Ansible are strongly advised to update.
