    When installing ``kolla-ansible`` from source, the ``kolla_ansible`` python
    module must now be installed in addition to the python dependencies listed
    in ``requirements.txt``. This is done via::

        pip install /path/to/kolla-ansible

    If the git repository is in the current directory, use the following
    to avoid installing the package from PyPI::

        pip install ./kolla-ansible
