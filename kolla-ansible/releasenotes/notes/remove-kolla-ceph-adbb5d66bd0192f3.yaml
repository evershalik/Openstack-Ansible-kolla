    Support for deploying Ceph has been removed, after it was deprecated in
    Stein. Please use an external tool to deploy Ceph and integrate it with
    Kolla Ansible deployed OpenStack by following the `external Ceph guide
    <https://docs.openstack.org/kolla-ansible/latest/reference/storage/external-ceph-guide.html>`__.
