    [`blueprint Replace inner-/external computes with a dvr mode variable <https://blueprints.launchpad.net/kolla-ansible/+spec/dvr_mode_property>`_]
    A new variable "neutron_compute_dvr_mode" is introduced. This variable
    controls whether a compute host has external connection and is
    allowed to do full-blown DVR or distributed routing is only used for
    tenant networking. Corresponding values are "dvr" and "dvr_no_external"
    The variable has to be set either globally or per group (per host)
    to get desired behavior.
upgrade:
  - |
    All hosts from "[inner-compute]" and "[external-compute]" can be moved to
    "[compute]" to avoid problems in OpenStack S release, though the groups
    still will function well in this release.
deprecations:
  - |
    Splitting of compute group into inner and external compute hosts is
    deprecated and will be removed in OpenStack S release.
fixes:
  - |
    External bridge setup on compute hosts that depends on whether DVR mode
    is enabled is also accompanied by a check for the new variable.
