    When upgrading from Rocky to Stein HAProxy configuration moves from using a
    single configuration to assembling a file from snippets for each service.
    Applying the HAProxy tag to the entire play ensures that HAProxy
    configuration is generated for all services when the HAProxy tag is
    specified. For details please see
