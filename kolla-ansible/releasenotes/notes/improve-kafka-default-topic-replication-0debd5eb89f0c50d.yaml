    An issue where when Kafka default topic creation was used to create a
    Kafka topic, no redundant replicas were created in a multi-node cluster.
    `LP#1888522 <https://launchpad.net/bugs/1888522>`__. This affects Monasca
    which uses Kafka, and was previously masked by the legacy Kafka client used
    by Monasca which has since been upgraded in Ussuri. Monasca users with
    multi-node Kafka clusters should consultant the Kafka `documentation
    <https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/>`__ to increase the number of
    replicas.
