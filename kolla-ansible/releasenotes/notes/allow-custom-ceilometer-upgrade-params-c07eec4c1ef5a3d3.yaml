    Allow operators to use custom parameters with the ceilometer-upgrade
    command. This is quite useful when using the dynamic pollster subsystem;
    that sub-system provides flexibility to create and edit pollsters configs,
    which affects Gnocchi resource-type configurations. However, Ceilometer
    uses default and hard-coded resource-type configurations; if one customizes
    some of its default resource-types, he/she can get into trouble during
    upgrades. Therefore, the only way to work around it is to use the
    ``--skip-gnocchi-resource-types`` flag.
