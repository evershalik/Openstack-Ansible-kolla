upgrade:
  - |
    Changes the database backup procedure to use ``mariabackup`` which is
    compatible with MariaDB 10.3. The ``qpress`` based compression used
    previously is now replaced with ``gzip``. The documented restore procedure
    has been modified accordingly.  See the `Mariabackup documentation
    <https://mariadb.com/kb/en/library/mariabackup-overview/>`__ for further
    information.
deprecations:
  - |
    The ``enable_xtrabackup`` variable is deprecated in favour of
    ``enable_mariabackup``.
