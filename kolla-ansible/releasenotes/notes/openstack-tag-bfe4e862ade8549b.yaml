    Adds a new variable, ``openstack_tag``, which is used as the default Docker
    image tag in place of ``openstack_release``. The default value is
    ``openstack_release``, with a suffix set via ``openstack_tag_suffix``.
    The suffix is empty except on CentOS 8 where it is set to ``-centos8``.
    This allows for the availability of images based on CentOS 7 and 8.
