    Adds support for installing python dependencies into a virtualenv on remote
    hosts.

    Installing python packages directly to the system site-packages can cause
    various problems, in particular when pip overwrites a system package.
    Python virtualenvs are one solution to this issue, as they allow python
    packages to be installed in an isolated environment.  Typically we will
    need to enable use of system site-packages from within this virtualenv, to
    support the use of modules such as yum, apt, and selinux, which are not
    available on PyPI.

    The path to the virtualenv is configured via the ``virtualenv`` variable,
    and access to site-packages is controlled via ``virtualenv_site_packages``.
    The default value for ``virtualenv`` is None, in which case the old
    behaviour of installing packages directly to the system site-packages is
    maintained.

    When executing other kolla-ansible commands, the variable
    ``ansible_python_interpreter`` should be set to the python interpreter
    installed in ``virtualenv``. Note that this variable cannot be templated.
