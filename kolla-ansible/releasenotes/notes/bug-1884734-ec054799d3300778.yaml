    Fixes an issue when using ip addresses instead of hostnames in Ansible
    inventory. OpenvSwitch role sets system-id based on inventory_hostname,
    which in case of ip addresses in is first ip octet.
    Such a deployment would result in multiple OVN chassis with duplicate name
    e.g. "10" connecting to OVN Southbound database - which spawns high numbers
    of create/delete events in Encap database table - leading to near 100% CPU
    usage of OVN/OVS/Neutron processes.
