    Adds configuration to set `also_notifies` within the pools.yaml file
    when using the Infoblox backend for Designate.

    Pushing a DNS NOTIFY packet to the master does not cause the DNS update
    to be propagated onto other nodes within the cluster. This means each node
    needs a DNS NOTIFY packet otherwise users may be given a stale DNS record
    if they query any worker node. For details please see
    `bug 1855085 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/kolla-ansible/+bug/1855085>`__
