    Add support for the configuration of Infoblox as a pluggable
    IPAM driver in neutron. Configure by selecting 'infoblox' as
    the 'neutron_ipam_driver'. In addition to handling IP address
    management within neutron, an agent will be started to
    automatically manage DNS entries within the Infoblox appliance.
