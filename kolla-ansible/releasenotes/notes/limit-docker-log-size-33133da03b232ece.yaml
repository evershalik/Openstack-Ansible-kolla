features:
  - Docker logs are no longer allowed to grow unbounded and have
    been limited to a fixed size per container. Two new variables
    have been added, ``docker_log_max_file`` and ``docker_log_max_size`` which
    default to 5 and 50MB respectively. This means that for each container,
    there should be no more than 250MB of Docker logs.
