    Modifies the path for custom configuration of ``swift.conf`` from
    ``/etc/kolla/config/swift/<service>.conf`` to
    ``/etc/kolla/config/swift/<service>/swift.conf``, to avoid a collision with
    custom configuration for ``<service>.conf``. Here, ``<service>`` may be
    ``proxy-server``, ``account-*``, ``container-*`` or ``object-*``.
