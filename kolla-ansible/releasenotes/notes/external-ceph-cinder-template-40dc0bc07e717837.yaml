    The default behavior for generating the ``cinder.conf`` template has
    changed.  An ``rbd-1`` section will be generated when external Ceph
    functionality is used, i.e. ``cinder_backend_ceph`` is set to ``true``.
    Previously it was only included when Kolla Ansible internal Ceph
    deployment mechanism was used.
