features:
  - |
    Introduces user modifiable variables instead of fixed names for Ceph
    keyring files used by external Ceph functionality.
upgrade:
  - |
    For cinder (``cinder-volume`` and ``cinder-backup``), ``glance-api`` and
    ``manila`` keyrings behavior has changed and Kolla Ansible deployment will
    not copy those keys using wildcards (``ceph.*``), instead will use newly
    introduced variables. Your environment may render unusable after an upgrade
    if your keys in ``/etc/kolla/config`` do not match default values for
    introduced variables.
