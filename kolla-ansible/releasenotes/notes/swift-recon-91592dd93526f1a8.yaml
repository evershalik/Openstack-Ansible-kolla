    Adds support for Swift Recon.

    Adds the necessary configuration to the Swift account, container
    and object configuration files to enable the Swift recon cli.

    In order to give the object server on each Swift host access to the
    recon files, a Docker volume is mounted into each container which
    generates them. The volume is then mounted read only into the object
    server container. Note that multiple containers append to the same
    file. This should not be a problem since Swift uses a lock when
    appending.

    Example usage: `sudo docker exec swift_object_server swift-recon --all`
