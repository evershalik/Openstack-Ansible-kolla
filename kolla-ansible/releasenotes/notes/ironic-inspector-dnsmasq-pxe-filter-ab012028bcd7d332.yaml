    Adds support for the `Ironic Inspector dnsmasq PXE filter
    <https://docs.openstack.org/ironic-inspector/latest/admin/dnsmasq-pxe-filter.html>`__
    that provides improved scalability over the default IPTables PXE filter.
    This is now used by default instead of the ``iptables`` PXE filter.
    The ``iptables`` filter can be enabled by setting
    ``ironic_inspector_pxe_filter`` to ``iptables``.
upgrade:
  - |
    The default PXE filter used by Ironic Inspector is now ``dnsmasq`` rather
    than ``iptables``.  This change has been made to work around an issue
    introduced by moving to Docker CE, where the daemon sets the default
    policy on the ``iptables`` ``FORWARD`` chain to ``DROP``. This policy can
    interact with the Ironic Inspector ``iptables`` PXE filter to cause DHCP
    packets from bare metal nodes to get dropped, which prevents provisioning.
