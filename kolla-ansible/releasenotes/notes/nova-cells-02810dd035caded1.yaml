    Adds initial support for deployment of multiple Nova cells. Cells allow
    Nova clouds to scale to large sizes, by sharding the compute hosts into
    multiple pools called *cells*.

    This feature is still evolving, and the associated configuration may be
    liable to change in the next release to support more advanced deployment
    topologies.
