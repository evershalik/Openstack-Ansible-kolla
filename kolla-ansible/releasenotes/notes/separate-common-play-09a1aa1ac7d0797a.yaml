    Extracts the common role into a separate play. This provides a performance
    benefit at scale, since the role dependency mechanism used previously had a
    overhead. This change allows the only common role to be executed by
    specifying the ``common`` tag.
upgrade:
  - |
    The common role is now executed in a separate play. This introduces a few
    small changes in behaviour:

    * the common role is now run for all hosts at the beginning, rather than
      prior to their first enabled service
    * hosts must be in the necessary group for each of the common services
      (``cron``, ``fluentd``, ``kolla-logs``, ``kolla-toolbox``) in order to
      have that service deployed
    * if tags are specified for another service e.g. nova, the common role
      will *not* automatically run for matching hosts. The common tag must
      be specified explicitly
