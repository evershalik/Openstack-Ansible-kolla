    When ``etcd`` is used with ``cinder_coordination_backend``
    and/or ``designate_coordination_backend``, the config has been changed
    to use the ``etcd3gw`` (aka ``etcd3+http``) ``tooz`` coordination driver
    instead of ``etcd3`` due to issues with the latter's availability and
    stability. ``etcd3`` does not handle well eventlet-based services,
    such as cinder's and designate's.
    See bugs `1852086
    <https://bugs.launchpad.net/kolla-ansible/+bug/1852086>`__ and `1854932
    <https://bugs.launchpad.net/kolla-ansible/+bug/1854932>`__
    for details.
