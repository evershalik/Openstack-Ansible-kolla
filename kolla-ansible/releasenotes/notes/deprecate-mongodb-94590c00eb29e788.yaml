    Deprecates support for deploying MongoDB. In Victoria support for
    deploying MongoDB will be removed from Kolla Ansible. Note CentOS 8
    already lost support for MongoDB due to decisions made upstream.

    This affects Panko as it will no longer be possible to get automatic
    deployment of MongoDB database for it. However, the default, SQL,
    backend is and will be supported via MariaDB.

    MongoDB lost its position in OpenStack environment after
    controversial relicensing under their custom SSPL (Server Side
    Public License) which did not pass OSI (Open Source Initiative)
    validation.
