upgrade:

    In Train, Tacker started using local filesystem to store VNF
    packages and CSAR files.
    Kolla Ansible provides no shared filesystem capabilities, hence only
    one instance of each Tacker service is deployed and all on the same host.
    Previous multinode deployments will be descaled when running upgrade.
