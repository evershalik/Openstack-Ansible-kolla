    Deprecates support for deploying Ceph. In a future release support for
    deploying Ceph will be removed from Kolla Ansible. Prior to this we will
    ensure a migration path to another tool such as `Ceph Ansible
    <http://docs.ceph.com/ceph-ansible/master/>`__ is available. For new
    deployments it is recommended to use another tool to deploy Ceph to avoid a
    future migration. This can be integrated with OpenStack by following the
    `external Ceph guide
    <https://docs.openstack.org/kolla-ansible/latest/reference/storage/external-ceph-guide.html>`__.
