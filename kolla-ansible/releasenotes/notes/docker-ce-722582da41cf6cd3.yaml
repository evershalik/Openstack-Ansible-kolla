    Adds support for installing Docker Community Edition (CE) using the
    ``kolla-ansible bootstrap-servers`` command.  Existing support uses the
    legacy packages from https://dockerproject.org.  New packages are
    distributed via https://download.docker.com, and that location is now
    supported and used by default.  Use of the legacy packages is enabled by
    setting the variable ``docker_legacy_packages`` to ``true``.

    It is also now possible to skip configuration of the Docker repository, by
    setting the variable ``enable_docker_repo`` to ``false``.

    The default value for ``docker_legacy_packages`` is ``false``, which means
    that the Docker Community Edition (CE) should be installed. If the
    ``kolla-ansible bootstrap-servers`` command is used on a previously
    deployed host that is running a legacy Docker engine, it would result in
    the Docker engine being upgraded to use the Docker Community Edition
    packages, which will result in a restart of the Docker engine and the
    containers running on that host.  Use the ``kolla-ansible`` ``--serial`` or
    ``--limit`` arguments to avoid losing quorum in clustered services such as
    MariaDB by restarting all containers at once.
