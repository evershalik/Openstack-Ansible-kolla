features:
  - |
    Adds support for generating self-signed certificates for both the internal
    and external (public) networks via the ``kolla-ansible certificates``
    command. If they are the same network, then the certificate files will be
    the same.
upgrade:
  - |
    The default value for ``kolla_external_fqdn_cacert`` has been changed
    from:
    "{{ node_config }}/certificates/haproxy-ca.crt"
    to:
    "{{ node_config }}/certificates/ca/haproxy.crt"

    and the default value for ``kolla_external_fqdn_cacert`` has been changed
    from:
    "{{ node_config }}/certificates/haproxy-ca-internal.crt"
    to:
    "{{ node_config }}/certificates/ca/haproxy-internal.crt"

    These variables set the value for the ``OS_CACERT`` environment variable in
    ``admin-openrc.sh``. This has been done to allow these certificates to be
    copied into containers when ``kolla_copy_ca_into_containers`` is true.
