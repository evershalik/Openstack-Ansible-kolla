upgrade:
  - |
    Freezer now uses MariaDB as the default database backend.

    Elasticsearch remains as an optional backend due to the requirement of
    Freezer to use Elasticsearch version 2.3.0. Elasticsearch in kolla-ansible
    is 5.6.x and that doesn't work with Freezer.

    New variables have been added:: ``freezer_database_backend``,
    ``freezer_database_name``, ``freezer_database_user``,
    ``freezer_database_address``, ``freezer_elasticsearch_replicas``,
    ``freezer_es_protocol``, ``freezer_es_address``, ``freezer_es_port``
