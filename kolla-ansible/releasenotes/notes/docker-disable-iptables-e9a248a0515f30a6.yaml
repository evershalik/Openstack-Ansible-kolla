    Adds a new flag, ``docker_disable_default_iptables_rules``, which
    defaults to ``no``. Docker is manipulating iptables rules by
    default to provide network isolation, and this might cause
    problems if the host already has an iptables based firewall.
    A common problem is that Docker sets the default policy of the
    ``FORWARD`` chain in the ``filter`` to ``DROP``.
    Setting ``docker_disable_default_iptables_rules`` to ``yes``
    will disable Docker's iptables manipulation. This feature will be
    enabled by default from the Victoria 11.0.0 release.
