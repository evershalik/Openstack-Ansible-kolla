    Add a new flag to explicitly enable provider networks, i.e. networks where
    instances directly connect to the physical networks (flat, VLAN). In such
    cases external bridges must be configured on compute nodes, like it is done
    for self-service (tenant manageable) networks in DVR mode. Otherwise this
    flag allows to avoid unnecessary interface and bridge setup on compute
    nodes in case of tenant networks in non-DVR mode.

    By default this flag is disabled. If provider networks were used in
    previous releases, please set ``enable_neutron_provider_networks``
    property to 'yes'.
