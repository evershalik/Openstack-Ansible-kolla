    When deploying Monasca with Logstash 6, any
    custom Logstash 2 configuration for Monasca will need to be updated to
    work with Logstash 6. Please consult the `documentation
    <https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/logstash/master/upgrading-logstash.html>`__.

    6 is now deployed by default.
