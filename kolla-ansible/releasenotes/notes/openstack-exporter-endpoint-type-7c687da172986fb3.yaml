    The Prometheus OpenStack exporter now uses internal endpoints to
    communicate with OpenStack services, to match the configuration of other
    services deployed by Kolla Ansible. Using public endpoints can be retained
    by setting the ``prometheus_openstack_exporter_endpoint_type`` variable to
    ``public``.
