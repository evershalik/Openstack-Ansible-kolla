upgrade:
  - Set RabbitMQ ``cluster_partition_handling`` to ``pause_minority``.
    This is to avoid split-brain.
    The setting is overridable using custom config.
    Note this new config requires at least 3-node RabbitMQ cluster
    to provide HA (High Availability).
    See production architecture guide for more info.
