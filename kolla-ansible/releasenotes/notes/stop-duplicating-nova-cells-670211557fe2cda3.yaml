    While Kolla Ansible now avoids duplicating Nova cells when messaging or
    database connection information are changed, operators of existing
    deployments should perform a manual cleanup of duplicate cells using the
    ``nova-manage cell_v2`` command from a container running the ``nova_api``
    image, leaving only two cells, one named ``cell0`` and another one with the
    right connection information.
