    Removes the ``[http]/max-row-limit = 10000`` setting from the default
    InfluxDB configuration, which resulted in the CloudKitty v1 API returning
    only 10000 dataframes when using InfluxDB as a storage backend. See `bug
    1862358 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/kolla-ansible/+bug/1862358>`__ for
    details.
