    Modifies the default storage backend for Cloudkitty to InfluxDB, to match
    the default in Cloudkitty from Stein onwards. This is controlled via
    ``cloudkitty_storage_backend``. To use the previous default, set
    ``cloudkitty_storage_backend`` to ``sqlalchemy``. See `bug 1838641
    <https://bugs.launchpad.net/kolla-ansible/+bug/1838641>`__ for details.
