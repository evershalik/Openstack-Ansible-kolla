    Changes the default path for certificates generated via ``kolla-ansible
    certificates`` from ``{[ node_config_directory }}/certificates`` to
    ``{{ node_config }}``.  ``{{ node_config }}`` is the directory containing
    ``globals.yml``, which by default is ``/etc/kolla/``. This makes
    certificates consistent with other locally generated files, such as
    ``admin-openrc.sh``.
