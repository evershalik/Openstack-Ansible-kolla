    Update designate to allow use of external bind9 dns servers.
    Added two new properties:

    - designate_backend_external

      This defaults to 'no', and can be enabled by setting
      it to 'bind9'

    - designate_backend_external_bind9_nameservers

      This defaults to an empty string, and should be populated
      with a csv list of external bind9 dns server addresses.

    - Configuration override files to align with external bind9
      dns servers must be supplied manually,

      - /etc/kolla/config/designate/rndc.key
      - /etc/kolla/config/designate/rndc.conf
