upgrade:
  - |
    Apache ZooKeeper will now be automatically deployed whenever Apache Storm
    is enabled.
fixes:
  - |
    Deploys Apache ZooKeeper if Apache Storm is enabled explicitly. ZooKeeper
    would only be deployed if Apache Kafka was also enabled, which is often
    done implicitly by enabling Monasca.
